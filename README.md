This is a Simple Audio Spectrum Visualizer written in Python.
Uses a FFT algorithm and the pygame library to display frequencies of audio data from the current default audio input.
I find it useful for testing the quality of audio input equipment to make sure high frequencies are found.
To Do: Allow options to resize window, recolor gradient on the bars, improve UI.
